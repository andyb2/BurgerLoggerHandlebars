# Description

The purpose of this project was to make a web app that will submit a burger entry. When the burger is submitted it will be moved to a list on the left hand side called "Burgers!". The burger entry will then be "eatable". When the user clicks on the eat button the burger will then be moved to the "Eaten Burger!" column

This mini project was a way for use to do a full deployment from frontend-backend-database. This project must include the use of `handlebars.js`.

Goals for project:

1. Burgers submitted must go to a database.
2. Burgers must be viewable in a list
3. Burgers must have a button that will "eat" the burger and switch the boolean value to true.
4. After eaten, the burger will move to the eaten column on the rightside
